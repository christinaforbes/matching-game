# Card Matching Game (Fall 2021)
A card matching game developed as the final project for my Interactive Scripting: jQuery course. The user reveals a cardâ€™s contents by clicking on the card. When the user consecutively clicks two matching cards, the cards are removed from the screen. The user wins the game after matching all the cards.
